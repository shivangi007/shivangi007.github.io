For a long time now, this new Microsoft product has had my attention. I thought of giving it a look, it's an in-browser application, which means it does not at all needs to be installed, or eats away your space in the computer. simply go to the url and start making your own little apps and games! This is how we envisioned the future of Mobile app development. It is not about the fact that the language is semantically different or more efficient. The simple question of can we do away with keyboards in development has been answered with this platform. All we have to do it is, open it in any device(tablet or mobile) and follow simple understandable steps to create an app which would otherwise take almost a week to make and test! 

Another important aspect is you get to test your app as you make it, so you can go on testing with out really publishing the script anywhere or building the application. At least, it looks like that! 
The entire purpose of this blog is to see the upcoming trends and derive useful information about different kinds of development on the touch develop app.

The scripting language is designed to be terse in style, as we are doing away with keyboard usage. The touch pad of phones and tablets is being used mostly, and the code is written in human friendly symbols. The language is very close to all the object oriented languages. It is very exciting to work with it, and I am looking forward to getting to know more about this platform, or IDE as many would like to call it!
